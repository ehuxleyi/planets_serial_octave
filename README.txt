This version of the Planets model is designed to be used with GNU Octave, a free 
numerical computing platform designed to be similar to MATLAB. 

To run this serial version of the model, follow these 5 steps:

1. use 7-zip or similar to extract the contents of "planets_serial_octave.zip" in a directory

2. Download and install Octave: https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html
    (this code has been developed in version 4.2.1; it may also work in other versions)

3. start Octave

4. in Octave, change the directory to where you extracted the files to in 1

5. enter the command "temperature_stability" in Octave's command window


Parameter values and settings can be edited in the file 'initialise.m'

This serial version runs single planets one after another, with full visualisation of 
climate feedbacks, perturbations and changes in planetary temperature through time.
